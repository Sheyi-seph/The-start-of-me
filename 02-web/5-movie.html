		<h1>Harry potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h1>
		<h2>Released in 2001</h2>
		<p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a magical adventure that follows Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who discovers on his 11th birthday that he's actually a wizard. Living with his horrible aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, Harry had no idea about his true heritage until the giant Hagrid arrives to take him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts, Harry makes his first real friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and learns about the dark wizard Voldemort who killed his parents.</p>
		<p>This movie is absolutely enchanting because it brings the magical world of Hogwarts to life in such a believable way. The friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione is heartwarming and genuine, and watching Harry discover that he finally belongs somewhere is incredibly touching. The castle, the moving staircases, the Great Hall with its floating candles - everything feels so wonderfully magical and makes you wish you could receive your own Hogwarts letter!</p>
		<p>My favorite scene is definitely the chess game where Ron sacrifices himself so Harry and Hermione can continue. When he says "That's chess!" and bravely steps forward, it shows his true courage and loyalty to his friends.
The way he's willing to risk everything for them proves that bravery comes in many forms, not just facing dark wizards.</p>
