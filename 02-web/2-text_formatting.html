    <h1>To move purposely to be attuned in mind</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>I wrote me a little letter.</strong><br />

      I will be <em>consistent</em> everyday, not because am perfect or
      disciplined. But for the <em>obsession</em> driven by my goals, daily
      walking in my plans towards those goals.<br />

      My feelings and body are my biggest enemies, I'll settle for peace with
      them in <del>gentle confrontation</del> violent confrontation. Then move on with an attuned killer mindset
      to slay the worlda.<br />

      It won't happen today, tomorrow, this month or the next, but someday, one
      day, gradually, my current goals would be eliminated. So to the me now:
      the journey is not about the end, nor the past. It's about dealing with
      today to build a small progress in the plan. Don't worry about any thing
      else and succeed now!
